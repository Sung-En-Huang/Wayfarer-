# Wayfarer

##💡 Inspiration##
Hours have been spent by our friend group trip planning, with many indecisive individuals and schedule clashes Wayfarer was created to resolve our trip planning horror.

##🔍 What it does##
Wayfarer automates the entire trip planning process by generating a full travel itinerary based on three major prompts entered by the user. The user inputs a sentence including their city of destination, trip dates, and budget. Our program than generates a travel itinerary displayed as a timeline with images and descriptions of the attractions showcased to the user. The user can than drag and drop the timeline as desired to fit their schedules and needs.

##⚙️ How it was built##
Wayfarer was built with the following tools and languages:

HTML
CSS
React
Co:here
FastAPI
SerpAPI

##🚧 Challenges we ran into##
In terms of front-end we ran into implementing a “search button” for our user prompt entry. We aimed to create a dynamic front end that would be user interactive (flipping + drag and drop functions).

For back-end, web scraping and finding the right google search API took the greatest amount of time. Each website had different html architectures which resulted in us web scraping each website that was visited

##✔️ Accomplishments that we're proud of####
Within 24 hours, we were able to pick up on implementing different google search APIs we have never worked with prior. We showed great grit in completing a demo-able project.

Additionally...

Learning the ins and outs of React Working with and handling pre-made APIs Connecting Front + Back End and understanding how API end points and requests work

##📚 What we learned##
Throughout DH9, we were all able to improve our skills as programmer and learn the ins and outs of search APIs and web scrapping.

##🔭 What's next for##
Wayfarer is looking to wayfare into the AI and ML realm to optimizer itinerary generation through user data and experience. Further more, we seek to implement voice to text recognition which will allow users to utilize Siri/Google Assistant or any other voice assistants to generate full fledged itineraries for them.
